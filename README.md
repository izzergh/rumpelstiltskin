Gain power over a symbol by knowing its name.

This is a vim plugin that lets you fuzzy search for Unicode symbols.
It uses the completion functionality provided by [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  and thus that's a dependency.
It is designed to be extendable and customizable, but with solid defaults.

# Caveat
This is my first plugin, so it may do something that breaks your general setup.
I tried to avoid that where I thought it would come up, (e.g. using `fzf#wrap`
  where applicable) but I probably missed something.
Issues and PRs are welcome in that case, just please be kind!

# Installation
First, install `fzf.vim`. **This plugin will not work without `fzf.vim`**.

Then, simply use your favorite vim plugin manager:

## Vundle
```
Plugin 'izzergh/rumpelstiltskin'
```

## Vim-Plug
```
Plug 'izzergh/rumpelstiltskin'
```

# Customization

Normal mode and Insert mode keybinds are configurable in separate ways because
  insert mode commands are weird and I don't quite get how to use them!

## Normal Mode

Installing this plugin gives you the following commands:

### Normal Mode Commands
|Command|Description|
|-|-|
|`:RumpelCLDR`|Opens an FZF window to search the [CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/#h.59ffxi4tj4wz) set of Unicode characters|
|`:RumpelFull`|Opens an FZF window to search all unicode codepoints (except newline...)|
|`:RumpelEmoji`|Opens an FZF window to search all emoji|

Example mapping:

```vim
nmap <Leader>: :RumpelCLDR
```

## Insert Mode
Insert mode is a little weird because I don't know how to do it better.
The plugin provides the following public functions:

### Insert Mode Functions
|Function|Description|
|-|-|
|`rumpelstiltskin#cldr_complete()`|Opens a mini FZF pop-up to search the [CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/#h.59ffxi4tj4wz) set of Unicode characters|
|`rumpelstiltskin#full_complete()`|Opens a mini FZF pop-up to search all unicode codepoints (except newline...)|
|`rumpelstiltskin#emoji_complete()`|Opens a mini FZF pop-up to search all emoji|

These come with a default mapping (see table below) which can be overwritten
  by assigning a string to the corresponding variable.

### Insert Mode Variables
|Variable|Corresponding function|Default value|
|-|-|-|
|`g:rumpelstiltskin_cldr_i`|`rumpelstiltskin#cldr_complete()`|`'<C-X>:'`|
|`g:rumpelstiltskin_full_i`|`rumpelstiltskin#full_complete()`|`'<C-X>u'`|
|`g:rumpelstiltskin_emoji_i`|`rumpelstiltskin#emoji_complete()`|`'<C-X>e'`|

Customizing these looks like:

```vim
let g:rumpelstiltskin_cldr_i = ':cldr'
```

**NOTE** The way the insert mode customization works requires a restart of vim,
  not just a `source`.
This is the weirdness referred to earlier. Sorry! It's on the roadmap.

# Predicted Frequently Asked Questions (PFAQ)
## What are these "Sets"?
Unicode provides various charts for public download.
Each Unicode character has a codepoint and a name, but various combinations of
  that data result in various levels of utility for fuzzy-search functionality.

Here is what's in each:

- **Full** is the "full" set of unicode characters. "Full" is in quotes because
  attentive readers will notice it only has about 32k characters (not 144k)!
  It's just what Unicode.org lists in UnicodeData.txt. If you know of a place
  where I can get _all_ characters in one place, plese submit an issue or PR!
  These characters have one name, maybe another that adds or removes a
  preposition or uses a synonym for one of the words. This source also includes
  the codepoint for each character.
- **CLDR** contains a subset of common characters that have _multiple_ names.
  This set is just the English localization, because that's the language I know
  best! Customization is coming, this is not the final state of the plugin!
  **This is, in my opinion, the best set for fuzzy-searching**.
  Each character (or set of characters, e.g. with skin tone) has several common
  names, so if you "kinda" know what you're looking for, it's still helpful.
- **Emoji** contains what Unicode describes as "emoji". Each has one name, and
  the group it belongs to (e.g. "face-unwell" is a group including ü•µ and ü§Æ)

## Why are some of these emoji several characters wide?
Many terminals do not support ZWJ (zero-width join) emoji, and instead
  render all the composite characters and the ZWJ control characters.
Rest assured that a text file that has emoji added with this plugin in vim
  and exported to a format that _does_ support ZWJ, it will render normally.
For example, if you are reading this on GitHub, the following will appear as
  the transgender pride flag, but in most terminals it will appear as its
  composite characters: üè≥‚Äç‚öß.

My setup also likes to eat characters after `U+200D` appears. It's super weird.

For the same reason, your fuzzy search window may have some artifacts when it
  scrolls across entries with the ZWJ joiner.
It still works fine and in testing, I found it still totally legible.

# Upcoming changes! (a.k.a. the wishlist)
* Add extension support and documentation for extension
* Add "similar plugins" section
* Supplement math symbols with LaTeX names, where applicable
* List sources and include bash scripts for formatting from the source
* Add tutorial/practice file
