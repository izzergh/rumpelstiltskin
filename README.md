Gain power over a symbol by knowing its name.

This is a vim plugin that lets you fuzzy search for Unicode symbols.
It uses the completion functionality provided by [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
  and thus that's a dependency.
It is deisgned to be extendable and customizable, but with solid defaults.

# Installation
First, install `fzf.vim`. **This plugin will not work without `fzf.vim`**.

Then, simply use your favorite vim plugin manager. I use `vundle`,
  which looks like this:

## Vundle
```
Plugin 'izzergh/rumpelstiltskin'
```

# Upcoming changes! (a.k.a. the wishlist)
* Add customization support and documentation for customization
* Add extension support and documentation for extension
* Add "similar plugins" section
* Supplement math symbols with LaTeX names, where applicable
* List sources and include bash scripts for formatting from the source
* Add one of them neat gifs showing the plugin in action
* Add tutorial/practice file
